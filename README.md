# Car Dealership ERD - Database Creation Project

Create a new database using an ERD.

The files needed to be turned in are:
- The ERD PDF
- SQL code that would be used to create the new database

Once the database has been created, create your own database inside of DBeaver. Also, once the database and the tables are created, have AT LEAST 2 pieces/records of data inside of the tables.

At least 2 of the inserts should come from a stored function.

Once the code is completed, commit both the PDF of the ERD diagram and the SQL code to github.
